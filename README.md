# Block Puzzle Solver


# ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Update** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üöÄ **New Version Available!** üöÄ  
As of **November 23, 2024**, a new and improved version of the Tangram Puzzle Solver is available.  
Access it here: [Tangram Puzzle Solver (New Version)](https://github.com/JozefJarosciak/TangramPuzzleSolver)

üîó **Why Update?**  - The new version includes enhanced algorithms, optimized performance, and improved features for solving puzzles efficiently.

# Description
The **Block Puzzle Solver** is a tool designed to calculate solutions for tangram-style puzzles based on monomino, domino, triomino, tetromino, and pentomino shapes within a user-defined rectangular or square area. It supports **block rotation** and **reflection** for maximum flexibility.

## Features

- **Fast Mode**: Generates solutions using random, unique block combinations for quick results.
- **Slow Mode**: Exhaustively tests all possible block combinations and permutations, ensuring comprehensive coverage (though this can involve a significant number of possibilities).

## Future Plans

- Expand support to include more complex shapes like **heptominoes**, **octominoes**, and other **polyominoes**.
- Enable support for user-defined areas of **any shape**, not limited to rectangles or squares.

This repository is ideal for puzzle enthusiasts, developers, or anyone interested in algorithmic problem-solving with polyomino-based puzzles.

*Note: While the program may work in other browsers, I've only tested it in those listed above.*


# Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome and encouraged!  

Currently, I am seeking an **equation-based approach** to eliminate early cases where no solution exists efficiently. If you're interested, check out this discussion for more context: [Tetromino Tiling: How to Eliminate Early Cases with No Solution](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2602742/tetronimo-tiling-with-given-tiles-how-to-eliminate-early-cases-where-no-soluti).
